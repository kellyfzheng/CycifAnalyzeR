# CycifDataAnalysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `CycifDataAnalysis` is to perform QC and Basic analysis such
as cell type calling on quantification (csv) files generated by
[mcmicro](https://mcmicro.org/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of CycifDataAnalysis from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kenichi-shimada/CycifDataAnalysis")
```

Some software installation outside R is needed prior to running the
above command.

## Example - TBD

``` r
library(CycifDataAnalysis)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'CycifDataAnalysis'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     transform
## basic example code
```

A workflow script will be added shortlyâ€¦

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
