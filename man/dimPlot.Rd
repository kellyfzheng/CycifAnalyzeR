dimPlot(x, ...)

\S4method{dimPlot}{CycifStack}(
  x,

\arguments{
\item{x}{A CycifStack object}

\item{...}{other arguments  passed to plot()}

\item{pch}{pch passed to plot()}

\item{type}{character, indicating how cells are colored. 'cell_type' is cell types
computed prior to the plotting, 'smpl' show the samples the cells derived from,
and 'exp' is expression of one antibody. When 'cell_type' and 'exp', additional
parameters needs to be provided.}

\item{celltype}{a factor with the length of cell number, indicating cell types computed
elsewhere. This needs to be provided when type is 'cell_type'.}

\item{ab}{character, indicating one channel/antibody. This needs to be provided when
type is 'exp'.}

\item{uniq.cols}{color sets used for the plot()}

\item{main}{main passed to plot()}
}
